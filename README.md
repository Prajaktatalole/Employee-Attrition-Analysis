# Employee-Attrition-Analysis

This project focused on predicting employee attrition and identifying key factors contributing to it using machine learning classification algorithms. The process began with data cleaning and preprocessing, which involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to uncover trends and correlations between various features such as employee tenure, job satisfaction, salary, and department.

Multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, were applied to build the prediction model. The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring their robustness in predicting employee turnover.

The insights gained from this analysis provided valuable recommendations to HR departments, highlighting the critical factors influencing attrition and offering potential strategies to improve employee retention.

Future Scope:

Implementing more advanced models like XGBoost and neural networks for improved accuracy.
Exploring time-series analysis to predict attrition trends over time.
Integrating external data such as employee engagement surveys to enhance prediction capabilities.
